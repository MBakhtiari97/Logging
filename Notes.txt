Logging in C#:
-log is one of the most critical part of any application.
-we can log use the default c# log system or other libraries
-one of the most famous libraries for C# log is serilog and it is a must known
-log has some severity like log info (green) , warning log , critical log and so on
-logs are assosciated with categories and that allows us to configure things differently
-basic ways of log is combination of log category and log level
-what is that log level ? =>
it has to do with severity of the logs.
logs comes with different sizes
so :
LogDebug is one of the log levels (lowest severity)(in builtin logging provider)
LogTrace is another type of log levels
LogWarning is another log level
LogError is one other 
LogCritical is also another log level (highest severity)(in builtin logging provider)

also there is an enum for log levels and you can use it to remember log levels

    //     enabled in a production environment.
    Trace,
    //
    // Summary:
    //     Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs
